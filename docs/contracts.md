# Contracts

## Purpose

This document defines the stable file and schema contracts used across the HomoRepeat workflow.

A contract is a promise:
- what a step receives
- what a step emits
- which columns are required
- which IDs must remain stable

If implementation changes but the contract remains valid, downstream steps should continue to work.

---

## General rules

### 1. Tabular intermediates use TSV
Unless otherwise stated, structured intermediate outputs should be TSV files with headers.

### 2. UTF-8 everywhere
All text outputs must be UTF-8 encoded.

### 3. One row = one biological unit
Each table must define its row unit clearly.

### 4. Stable column names
Column names are part of the contract and should not change casually.

### 5. Missing values
Missing values must be encoded consistently as empty fields unless a documented sentinel is required.

### 6. Method outputs must be schema-compatible
Pure, threshold, and seed-extend outputs must share the same call schema.

---

## Canonical identifiers

The following internal identifiers are recommended:

- `genome_id`
- `taxon_id`
- `sequence_id`
- `protein_id`
- `call_id`

Rules:
- internal IDs must be stable within a pipeline run
- downstream tables should prefer internal IDs over fragile filename parsing
- external identifiers may be preserved in separate columns

---

## Acquisition contract

Workflow driver note:
- the current Nextflow pipeline starts from a plain-text accession list, one assembly accession per line
- downstream acquisition normalization still emits the flat canonical artifacts documented below
- taxonomy DB location is treated as a runtime dependency, not a biological input record

### Input: `acquisition_targets.tsv`

One row per acquisition target to normalize into the workflow contracts.

Required columns:
- `source`
- `genome_name`
- `taxon_id`

Source-specific required columns:
- for `source=ncbi_datasets`: `accession`
- for `source=local`: at least one of `cds_fasta` or `protein_fasta`

Optional columns:
- `accession`
- `assembly_type`
- `assembly_level`
- `species_name`
- `taxon_name`
- `parent_taxon_id`
- `annotation_gff`
- `cds_fasta`
- `protein_fasta`
- `notes`

Rules:
- `source` must currently be one of: `ncbi_datasets`, `local`
- rows in `acquisition_targets.tsv` are intent records, not downstream biological entities
- local-mode paths must be readable from the execution environment
- local mode should prefer `cds_fasta` plus `annotation_gff` when translation-driven normalization is desired
- NCBI mode must retain the downloaded package path in `genomes.tsv.download_path`

### Output: `genomes.tsv`

One row per genome or assembly-level unit.

Required columns:
- `genome_id`
- `source`
- `accession`
- `genome_name`
- `assembly_type`
- `taxon_id`

Optional columns:
- `assembly_level`

---

## Taxonomy contract

### Output: `taxonomy.tsv`

One row per taxonomic unit.

Required columns:
- `taxon_id`

- `translation_method`
- `translation_status`

---

## Detection call contract

### Outputs
- `pure_calls.tsv`
- `seed_extend_calls.tsv`
- `threshold_calls.tsv`
- `repeat_calls.tsv`

Each row represents one detected homorepeat region.

Required columns:
- `call_id`
- `method`
- `genome_id`
- `taxon_id`
- `sequence_id`
- `protein_id`
- `start`
- `end`
- `length`
- `repeat_residue`
- `repeat_count`
- `non_repeat_count`
- `purity`
- `aa_sequence`

Optional but strongly recommended columns:

- `codon_metric_name`
- `codon_metric_value`
- `window_definition`
- `template_name`
- `merge_rule`
- `score`
- `source_file`

### Rules
- `method` must be one of: `pure`, `threshold`, `seed_extend`
- `repeat_calls.tsv` is the canonical merged export for downstream database and app ingestion
- `start` and `end` use the same coordinate system across all methods
- `repeat_residue` is the targeted amino-acid residue for the call
- `length` is the total tract length, including non-target residues if the method definition allows them
- `purity` is a numeric fraction from 0 to 1
- `aa_sequence` must reflect the called tract sequence exactly
- for `pure`, `aa_sequence` is expected to be a contiguous run of `repeat_residue`
- for `threshold`, `window_definition` should record the qualifying sliding-window rule, such as `Q6/8`
- for `seed_extend`, `window_definition` should record both seed and extend rules, such as `seed:Q6/8|extend:Q8/12`

---

## Finalized detection output contract

Method-specific finalized outputs publish under:

- `publish/detection/finalized/<method>/<repeat_residue>/`

Expected finalized artifacts:
- `final_<method>_<repeat_residue>_calls.tsv`
- `final_<method>_<repeat_residue>_run_params.tsv`
- `final_<method>_<repeat_residue>_codon_warnings.tsv`
- `final_<method>_<repeat_residue>_codon_usage.tsv`

Rules:
- `publish/calls/` remains the canonical merged interface for downstream database and reporting stages
- finalized method outputs are method-specific and may exist for multiple residues in the same run
- finalized call tables must still satisfy the shared detection call contract

---

## Codon usage contract

### Output: `codon_usage.tsv`

One row per finalized call, amino acid, and codon.

Required columns:
- `call_id`
- `method`
- `repeat_residue`
- `sequence_id`
- `protein_id`
- `amino_acid`
- `codon`
- `codon_count`
- `codon_fraction`

Rules:
- `codon_fraction` is computed within each `call_id` plus `amino_acid` group
- `codon_fraction` values within one `call_id` plus `amino_acid` group must sum to `1`
- codon usage is derived only from validated `codon_sequence` values
- `codon_metric_name` and `codon_metric_value` remain reserved compatibility fields on the main call row and may remain empty

---

## Method-specific parameter record contract

### Output: `run_params.tsv`

One row per method, repeat residue, and configuration parameter.

Required columns:
- `method`
- `repeat_residue`
- `param_name`
- `param_value`

Purpose:
- preserve method settings used in a given run
- support traceability
- make database builds auditable

Rules:
- `repeat_residue` is the amino-acid target for the parameter block
- `repeat_residue` must be a single uppercase amino-acid symbol
- `run_params.tsv` must not encode `repeat_residue` as a `param_name`; residue scoping lives in the dedicated column
- `(method, repeat_residue, param_name)` must be unique in the canonical merged output
- finalized `final_<method>_<repeat_residue>_run_params.tsv` files must contain only rows whose `repeat_residue` matches the path component

---

## Status artifact contracts

### Output: `publish/status/accession_status.tsv`

One row per requested assembly accession.

Required columns:
- `assembly_accession`
- `batch_id`
- `download_status`
- `normalize_status`
- `translate_status`
- `detect_status`
- `finalize_status`
- `terminal_status`
- `failure_stage`
- `failure_reason`
- `n_genomes`
- `n_proteins`
- `n_repeat_calls`
- `notes`

Rules:
- `n_repeat_calls` is the aggregate count across all enabled methods and repeat residues for that accession
- `terminal_status` is the accession-level summary state for the whole run
- `finalize_status=skipped` is valid when detection completed successfully but emitted no calls for that accession across the enabled methods and residues

### Output: `publish/status/accession_call_counts.tsv`

One row per requested assembly accession, observed method, and observed repeat residue.

Required columns:
- `assembly_accession`
- `batch_id`
- `method`
- `repeat_residue`
- `detect_status`
- `finalize_status`
- `n_repeat_calls`

Rules:
- rows are emitted for method plus repeat-residue combinations observed in the run-level detection status inputs or finalized call fragments
- `n_repeat_calls` is scoped to one accession plus method plus repeat-residue combination
- `finalize_status=skipped` is valid when the detect stage succeeded for that accession plus method plus repeat-residue combination but emitted no calls, so no finalize task was launched
- this table is a companion detail artifact; `accession_status.tsv` remains the accession-level operational ledger

---

## Run manifest contract

### Output: `publish/manifest/run_manifest.json`

Required top-level keys:
- `run_id`
- `status`
- `started_at_utc`
- `finished_at_utc`
- `profile`
- `git_revision`
- `inputs`
- `paths`
- `params`
- `enabled_methods`
- `repeat_residues`
- `artifacts`

Rules:
- `params.detection` is derived from the canonical published `calls/run_params.tsv` when present
- `params.detection` is shaped as `method -> repeat_residue -> param_name -> param_value`
- `enabled_methods` is the sorted list of methods present in `params.detection`
- `artifacts.detection.finalized_root`, when present, points to `publish/detection/finalized`
- `repeat_residues` is the sorted set of `repeat_residue` column values present in the published run params
- `artifacts.status.accession_call_counts_tsv`, when present, points to `publish/status/accession_call_counts.tsv`
- artifact paths are stored relative to the run root so the manifest remains portable inside `runs/<run_id>/`
- `params.params_file_values` may be empty when no params file was provided or when the supplied file is not JSON

---

## Cross-run merged view contract

### Purpose

This contract defines how multiple imported runs may be collapsed for merged browser
views and merged summaries.

It applies to the Django/Postgres web layer only.

It does not change the canonical published TSV artifacts.

### Core rules

- imported biological rows remain run-scoped and immutable after import
- cross-run merge logic must be derived and read-only
- never upsert one run’s `Genome`, `Sequence`, `Protein`, or `RepeatCall` rows into another run
- merged results must be deterministic: the same source rows must produce the same merged rows regardless of import order
- every merged row must retain links back to all contributing source rows and source runs

### Genome merge contract

Merged genome grouping unit:

- one merged genome group per non-empty `accession`

Rules:

- all imported `Genome` rows with the same `accession` belong to the same merged genome group
- `accession` is a grouping key, not a destructive upsert key
- grouped genome rows must remain individually browsable by source run

### Exact repeat-call collapse contract

Merged repeat-call collapse is exact-match only.

Exact merged call fingerprint:

- `accession`
- `protein_name`
- `protein_length`
- `method`
- `start`
- `end`
- `repeat_residue`
- `length`
- normalized `purity`

Rules:

- source rows with identical exact-call fingerprints collapse to one merged call record
- rows differing on any fingerprint field remain distinct merged call records
- `normalized purity` means the published numeric value compared through one canonical decimal representation, not raw binary float identity
- `aa_sequence` remains source provenance and may be displayed or inspected, but does not control cross-run collapse
- non-fingerprint fields may be displayed from source rows, but must not control collapse unless added to this contract explicitly

### Conflict handling

Rules:

- if grouped source rows disagree on fields outside the collapse fingerprint, the disagreement must remain attributable to the source rows
- merged views may expose explicit conflict flags or source-side detail panels
- merged views must not silently choose “last imported wins”

### Percentage and denominator rules

Rules:

- run-scoped percentages are computed only from one run’s imported rows
- cross-run percentages are computed only from the derived merged layer
- raw rows from multiple runs must not be summed directly when the same `accession` may appear more than once
- denominators such as analyzed protein count collapse once per merged genome group, not once per source row
- if grouped genome rows disagree on denominator fields such as analyzed protein count, the merged layer must surface that disagreement explicitly rather than silently overwriting one value with another

---

## Summary table contract

### Output: `summary_by_taxon.tsv`

One row per taxon and method.

Required columns:
- `method`
- `repeat_residue`
- `taxon_id`
- `taxon_name`
- `n_genomes`
- `n_proteins`
- `n_calls`
- `mean_length`
- `mean_purity`

Optional columns:
- `codon_metric_name`
- `mean_codon_metric`
- `median_length`
- `max_length`
- `mean_start_fraction`

---

## Regression input contract

### Output: `regression_input.tsv`

One row per grouped observation used in downstream regression.

Required columns:
- `method`
- `repeat_residue`
- `group_label`
- `repeat_length`
- `n_observations`

Optional columns:
- `codon_metric_name`
- `mean_codon_metric`
- `filtered_max_length`
- `transformed_codon_metric`

---

## Reporting contract

### Outputs
- `summary_by_taxon.tsv`
- `regression_input.tsv`
- `echarts_report.html`
- `echarts_options.json`
- `echarts.min.js`

Rules:
- all report outputs must be derivable from finalized tables or SQLite, not raw detection code
- `echarts_options.json` must be a valid JSON object keyed by chart name
- `echarts_report.html` must be reproducible from the JSON payload and analysis-ready tables
- `echarts_report.html` must render the required chart blocks present in `echarts_options.json`
- `echarts.min.js` must be shipped locally with the report bundle so the HTML report works without a CDN

---

## SQLite table contract

The initial v1 database schema owns the following tables:
- `genomes`
- `taxonomy`
- `sequences`
- `proteins`
- `repeat_calls`
- `run_params`

Rules:
- `repeat_calls` is the unified import target for `pure_calls.tsv`, `threshold_calls.tsv`, and `seed_extend_calls.tsv`
- flat files remain the canonical exchange artifacts even after import
- table and index definitions live under `src/homorepeat/resources/sql/sqlite/`

---

## SQLite ownership rules

### Database build philosophy
SQLite is not the source of truth during active computation.

The source of truth is:
- standardized flat outputs
- schema definition files
- parameter records

SQLite is the integrated build artifact.

### Import rules
- raw method outputs are imported only after validation
- indexes should be created after bulk import
- imports should run in transactions
- row count checks should be performed after import

---

## Validation rules

Every pipeline run should validate at least:

### Detection-level checks
- required columns exist
- no invalid method names
- `start <= end`
- `length > 0`
- `0 <= purity <= 1`

### Relational checks
- every `protein_id` in calls exists in proteins
- every `sequence_id` in proteins exists in sequences
- every `genome_id` exists in genomes

### Summary checks
- grouped counts are non-negative
- no impossible means
- method-level totals reconcile with source call tables

---

## File naming conventions

Preferred names:
- `genomes.tsv`
- `taxonomy.tsv`
- `sequences.tsv`
- `proteins.tsv`
- `pure_calls.tsv`
- `seed_extend_calls.tsv`
- `threshold_calls.tsv`
- `run_params.tsv`
- `summary_by_taxon.tsv`
- `regression_input.tsv`
- `homorepeat.sqlite`

Avoid embedding critical metadata only in filenames.

---

## Contract evolution policy

Contracts may evolve, but changes must be explicit.

If a contract changes:
- update this file
- update tests
- update downstream scripts
- document the versioned change in the changelog or roadmap

Do not silently change column names or semantics.
